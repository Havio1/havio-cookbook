# Havio's Cookbook
Created by Havio

## Backstory
After seeing food mods like ["Vanilla Cookbook"](https://modrinth.com/mod/vanillacookbook) and ["Farmer's Delight"](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight-fabric) I was inspired to try and make my own.

# What's Included?
- Boiled Egg : Obtained by cooking an egg.

- Boiled Turtle Egg : Obtained by cooking a turtle egg.
